We chose a scene from the popular game Minecraft as the theme for our project.
The model we created depicts a scene from the aforementioned game, featuring a building/house, a tree,
a Creeper that can be moved, a pig's head that can be scaled (zoomed in and out), 
and an animated sun that moves across the sky, illuminating other objects. The speed of the sun's movement can be changed.
The background and sky were created by texturing a cube with skybox graphics. Our project also features camera movement, 
a Phong lighting model, and the ability to enable a Gaussian blur effect.
